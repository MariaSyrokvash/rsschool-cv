## Summary:
 I started learning at [HTMLAcademy](https://htmlacademy.ru/) in 2019. I completed Level 1 and Level 2 of the HTML and CSS courses successfully and continued to learn JavaScript Level 1.
My classmate advised me to enroll in the RS School course, which he successfully completed. And here I am! I have enough motivation and self-discipline not to give up learning or burn out. Every day I improve my skills in web-development. I really want to develop in this area and be useful to myself and the people around me.
